```

Press `G` to generate new wallet.  
Enter a filename for your wallet (default is _wallet.bin_).  
Enter a passphrase for your wallet. *Warning:* There is no passphrase confirmation, so be careful!

### Get Your Address
In the running _simplewallet_ interface, type `address` and press enter.

### Start the Daemon
With _simplewallet_ running (in background or another terminal), run
```bash
./Turtlecoind
```

### Mine
With _simplewallet_ and `Turtlecoind` running (in background or another terminal), run

```bash
./miner --address <address>
```

### Check Your Balance
In the running _simplewallet_, type `balance` and press enter to see your balance.

### Send TurtleCoin
